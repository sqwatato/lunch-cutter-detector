# Line Cutter Detector

### Inspiration
The inspiration for this project was the horrible cutting in the lunch line at school. I thought it would be a fun idea to see who cut the line and capture their face.

### NOTE
The project will remail unfinished for a while due to the school year ending and me not being able to get solid footage of the line
